# ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
# against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
# address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
# 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
# for details. Typical usage is:
- name: Rate limit SSH port
  ufw: rule=limit port=ssh proto=tcp

- name: Allow SSH connections
  ufw: rule=allow name=OpenSSH

- name: Enable logging
  ufw: logging=on

- name: Enable Firewall
  ufw:
    state: enabled
    policy: deny
    direction: incoming

- name: Allow outgoing traffic
  ufw:
    policy: allow
    direction: outgoing
    state: reloaded
